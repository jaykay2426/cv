  <h3>Web Development</h3>
  <p>Becoming a web developer is a very interesting thing. Being able to create a website, style it, give it functions, make it responsive and all is one thing i love doing. It is a very interesting thing to do because it is one thing you can never stop learning.It is a very interesting thing to have as an occupation beacause you have diferent things to learn on a yearly, monthly, weekly, daily and hourly as well. it gives you opportunities to create new things and expand in thinking and code writing </p>

<h3>Playing musical instruments</h3>
<p>I love to play musical instruments when i have a free time. I do this alot to relax my head when i feel like im done with coding or i feel tired or probably when i feel like i need to rest my mind abit. I do play a few instruments like Bass guitar, Lead guitar, Acoustic guitar, Piano, Violin and a bit of Saxophone. I did learn all of this on my own apart from the last three instrumentst mentioned earlier bacause i got stuck learning them on my own at some point</p>

<p>Music Production</p>
<p>I learnt alot about music production a while ago at the beginning of 2022 and with all tajt ive learnt so far i can say ive not even gotten to 20%of music production. Yes i've been able to create musical audio, music instrumentals but still all i can say is ive still not lerant much. </p>
